<<A general Framework of Learning Multi-Vehicle Interaction Patterns from Videos>>

Abstract:
Using "Gaussian" velocity field to describe the time-varing multi-vehicle interaction behaviors
Then use the "Deep Autoencoders" to learn associated latent representation for each temporal frame.
Then use a "hidden semi-Markov" model with a "hierarchical Dirichlet process" as a prior to segment these sequential representations into granular
components, also called "traffic primitives"
